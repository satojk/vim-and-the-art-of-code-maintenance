For each request I make, I want you to reply only with the command and nothing else. Do not use backticks to delimit the bash command, do not write 'bash' in your response. Just the raw command, as if you were writing it in a terminal. Whenever you refer to a filename, use the alias FILENAME. Similarly use capital letters for any placeholder you're using. This is important, please make sure that any placeholders are capitalized!"
